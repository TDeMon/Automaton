Hello there, this is a fork of the original [Automaton mod](https://github.com/Djekke/Automaton) with some additional tweaks to make Cryofall less grindy.

Those tweaks, mainly, are:
 - autonavigation to the nearest rock or tree for AutoMiner and AutoWoodcutter features.
 - AutoWatering for your plants.
 
All features are buggy and I am not responsible for any broken chests, uprooted plants and game crashes when you are fighting a superior enemy force. Things may happen and by no means I won't fix the bugs I find noncritical. Though I tried to make this mod as stable as possible.
To make your life harder, I won't make distributives for this mod. It's a bit cheaty, after all. But if you still want to use it:
 - Download the repository as an archive
 - Unpack it
 - Repack it again as a .zip archive with no compression (that's important!). Also, check if Headers.xml is in root of your new archive.
 - Put to your mods folder, wherever it is: `%Steam%\steamapps\common\CryoFall\Mods` or `%Documents%\AtomicTorchStudio\CryoFall\Mods`.

And I won't make an AutoAim or AutoBulletDodging features. While this game requires a lot of everyday grind, some things like PvP are better left to player skills. That's more fair.

Have fun and enjoy!
